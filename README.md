# Hand-Drawn-Sketch-Classification

This project focuses on classifying hand-drawn sketches in real-time 
on a computer system using convolutional neural network at its core. 
In this project I used the MNIST dataset to train the base model 
and then applied this model on the main problem by the means of 
transfer learning.
